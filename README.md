# Data 512 Project: Wildfire Analysis

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of wildfires in the U.S, specifically near Murfreesboro, TN. Using wildfire data from [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81), this project estimated the smoke impact of wild fires within 650 miles of Murfreesboro, TN and compares this estimate to AQI data from US EPA Air Quality System (AQS) API. Additonally, a predictive model predicts the smoke impact estimates until 20250. The fires we are between the years 1961-2021 and we define wildfire season as May 1 - October 31.

### Data
- Wildfire data: The wildfire data comes from [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81). The file is too large to upload to the repository, but the file used in analysis was the USGS_Wildland_Fire_Combined_Dataset.json file from the GeoJSON download.
- AQI data: The AQI data came from the US EPA Air Quality System (AQS) API.

### Considerations
#### Distance:
Distance is calculated as the average distance of all perimeter points to the city, not quite what the centroid would be, but it is probably fairly close.
#### Smoke Impact Estimate:
The smoke impact estimate calculation was based off of the [Inverse Square Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law) which states that the '"intensity" of a specified physical quantity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity.' The calculation is $intensity \times \left(\frac{1}{distance^2}\right)$. However, after discussing with Sarah K., to ensure that the calculation is never dividing 0, I added 1 to the distance, so my calculation for each fire smoke impact estimate is $intensity \times \left(\frac{1}{(distance + 1)^2}\right)$. After calculating the smoke impact estimate for each fire, I created the yearly estimate by summing all the smoke impact estimates for each year. This calculation accounts for a decrease in value for when the fire is further away but also accounts for an increase in value when a fire is buring more acres. 
#### AQI Estimate:
My county only had 1 monitoring station that had data for SO2, NO2, and O2 for the years 1988-2012. After reading [this](https://document.airnow.gov/technical-assistance-document-for-the-reporting-of-daily-air-quailty.pdf) techincal document about how the AQI is calculated, I understood if mutltiple particles had a AQI score, the highest score out of all the available data was taken as the AQI score for that period. Taking this into account, I gathered all AQI data for the fire seasons, May 1 through October 31, years that were availble. Next, if a day had mutiple AQI values for the same day, I took the average of them to get a value for every day for each particle. Then I took the max of all the particles to get a daily AQI value. Then I took the average per year to get the AQI estimate for the year. This might not be reflective fo the true AQI value for my county since I did not have access to all the data points due to lack of monitoring station data.
#### Comparing Smoke Impact Estimate and AQI Estimate:
To compare the smoke impact estimate and AQI estimate, I plotted both of these values. Overall, both estimates are slightly moving up and to the right as years go on, but they do not have the same peaks, increases, or decreases. Additonally, I computed the correlation between the smoke impact estimate and aqi estimate and got that the value 0.279829 which indicates a slight positive correlation. Since the smoke impact estimate is a sum of all values per fire and AQI is an average for every day across a year, these values are hard to compare. Not only is the calculation making these values hard to compare, they are composed of different aspects. The AQI estimate that I had is based off of SO2, NO2, and O2, and NO2 is the only particle that is present in smoke, so the other 2, SO2 and O2, might not be a good indicator of smoke.
