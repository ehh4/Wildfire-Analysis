# Data 512 Project: Wildfire Analysis

### Project Goal

The goal of this project is to analyze the impact of wildfires in the U.S, specifically near Murfreesboro, TN. Using wildfire data from [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81), this project estimated the smoke impact of wild fires within 650 miles of Murfreesboro, TN and compares this estimate to AQI data from US EPA Air Quality System (AQS) API. Additonally, a predictive model predicts the smoke impact estimates until 20250. The fires we are between the years 1961-2021 and we define wildfire season as May 1 - October 31.

### Data
- Wildfire data: The wildfire data comes from [here](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/61aa537dd34eb622f699df81). The file is too large to upload to the repository, but the file used in analysis was the USGS_Wildland_Fire_Combined_Dataset.json file from the GeoJSON download.
- AQI data: The AQI data came from the US EPA Air Quality System (AQS) API.

### Considerations
#### Distance:
#### Smoke Impact Estimate:
The smoke impact estimate calculation was based off of the [Inverse Square Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law) which states that the '"intensity" of a specified physical quantity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source of that physical quantity.' The calculation is $intensity \times \left(\frac{1}{distance^2}\right)$. However, to ensure that the calculation is never dividing 0, I added 1 to the distance, so my calculation for each fire smoke impact estimate is $intensity \times \left(\frac{1}{distance^2}\right)$. After calculating the smoke impact estimate for each fire, I created the yearly estimate by summing all the smoke impact estimates for each year.
